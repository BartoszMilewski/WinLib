Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person or organization 
(User) obtaining a copy of the RSWL covered by this license for use in the 
development of any commercial or non-commercial software, all subject to the 
following:

RSWL and its derivatives may be distributed only by Reliable Software or 
RSWL distributors licensed by Reliable Software, hereafter called 
Distributors, unless such copies or derivative works are solely in the form 
of machine-executable object code generated by a source language processor.

The distribution of the RSWL source code to the User may only be done using 
Reliable Software Code Co-op version control system, with the User joining 
the designated RSWL project (operated by a Distributor) and receiving the 
source code as part of the join process. By remaining a member of the RSWL 
project, the User may receive occasional updates and/or bug fixes at Reliable 
Software's convenience.

(Note: The join may be done, and the project kept in sync, using an 
unlicensed version of Code Co-op. There is no requirement for the User to 
buy any Code Co-op licenses.)

After obtaining the initial distribution of RSWL from a Distributor, the 
User is free to distribute the copies of the RSWL source code (or the 
modifications of it) within their organization, not necessarily using Code 
Co-op, all subject to the following:

The copyright notices in the RSWL and this entire statement, including the 
above license grant, including this restriction and the following disclaimer, 
must be included in all copies of the RSWL, in whole or in part, and all 
derivative works of the RSWL.

The permission for commercial distribution of RSWL and its derivatives in the 
form of source code may only be granted by Reliable Software under a separate 
licensing agreement. Contact info@relisoft.com to obtain this license agreement.
