# WinLib
C++ Windows Library by Reliable Software

This is a Windows library written in C++ in the 90s and still functioning. 

It's an object-oriented library that's a thin encapsulation of the Windows API -- a response to the bulky and badly designed MFC. 

I have since moved to functional programming and Haskell, so I consider this obolete technology and am a little embarassed to be open-sourcing it.
