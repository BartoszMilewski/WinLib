- Acknowledments: After every change, Code Co-op waits for acknowledgments from all project members. If we don't receive the acknowledgments from you in a reasonable amount of time, we will have to remove you from project. This will happen, for instance, if you turn off your Dispatcher or stop downloading your e-mail. You'll still be left with RSWL sources, but you won't get updates.
